# Jobs are a collection of Steps. All of the steps in the job are executed in a single unit which consumes a CircleCI container from your plan while itâ€™s running.
# Job: "maven-build" job test and package the application with Maven, persist JAR in workspace and store it as Artefacts
# Job: "aws-deploy" job get binary from attached workspace and deploy to AWS
